# Two example instantiations of Universal Differential Equations using the DiffEqFlux package

A commented and lightly edited version

* Learning the real-valued parameters of an ODE system (Ex1) from the DiffEqFlux blog post https://julialang.org/blog/2019/01/fluxdiffeq/
 
* Learning an arbitrary function in an ODE system (Ex2) from https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas/universal_differential_equations

Both examples use the Lotka Volterra 2-sys of ODEs as the example.
